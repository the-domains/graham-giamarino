# We lead the way in cannabis cultivation with over 25 High Times Cannabis Cup Awards

People know they should make healthier choices, but when it comes to cannabis it's not always their first thought. We believe there is a clear difference and that everyone deserves cannabis that is clean, free from pesticides, metals and other residues. We're on a journey to change the way people think about and use cannabis. Combining ten years of cultivating experience with creativity and innovation; the result is a high quality cannabis experience, tailored to each member by knowledgeable recommendations made by our caring staff. Award-winning flower, including our vegan-organic strains, is available in full-melt concentrate, buds, clones and seeds. We use our widespread network to curate a variety of products that we know will be beneficial for our members in their effort to lead healthier, more vibrant lives.
